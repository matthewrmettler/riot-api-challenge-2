                    <p>Hey there! Welcome to Rylai's Resolve!</p>

                    <p>This website was made for the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/contests/riot-games-api-challenge-20">Riot API Challenge.</a>
                    I collected roughly 123,000 ranked matches across both patch 5.11 and 5.14, and started analyizing them. My goal with this project was to examine the second category: How did AP itemization change up the game? How did winrates and pickrates change?
                    More specifically, I wanted to focus on one item in particular: Rylai's Crystal Scepter.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    I've always loved Rylai's, but it used to be kind of a niche pick. It didn't offer all that much AP, so it was mainly picked up by tankier frontline mages,
                    such as Rumble or Vladimir. However, the changes to itemization not only made it contain more AP, but it also gave an amazing 40% slow on basically anything any mage did,
                    making it a <b>much</b> more attractive item for people to build.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    So that's the question: did people build it? How successful was it? Let's try to take a look.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Overall Winrates -->
            <div class="section" id="winrate_section">
                <div class="section-title">Overall Winrates</div>
                <div class="toc-list"><a href="#toc_section">Back to Top</a></div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        First, let's take at the overall winrate of all the AP champions (I'm defining an 'AP Champion' as anyone
                        who had more than 50 games played with more than 2 AP items built over the course of the game.).
                        Click any column to sort by it,or shift-click to have that be the second sort option.
                        All rows are color-coded by the patch 5.14 winrate.
                    </p>
                    <div class="table-container">
                        <table id="winrate-table">
                          <thead>
                            <th>Champion Name</th>
                            <th>Wins (5.11)</th>
                            <th>Losses (5.11)</th>
                            <th>Winrate (5.11)</th>
                            <th>Wins (5.14)</th>
                            <th>Losses (5.14)</th>
                            <th>Winrate (5.14)</th>
                            <th>Percent Change</th>
                          </thead>
                          <tbody>
                          </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Overall Pickrates -->
            <div class="section" id="pickrate_section">
                <div class="section-title">Overall Pickrates</div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Next, we can simply see who the most popular midlaners were by pickrate. Let's look at a pie chart.</p>

            </div>

            <!-- Rylai's Build Data (Table) -->

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Now, let's look to see who built Rylai's, in what order, and what the winrates are in that order.
                    We can first look at a very overwhelming table:</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Rylai's Build Data (Bar Chart) -->

                <div class="section-title">Rylai's Build Data Bar Chart</div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Now we can look at it in a more manageable bar graph. Each section is for one champion, and each sub-bar
                    is for what build order that Rylai's was built in.</p>
                </div>

                    This project was made primarily in Python and Javascript, and is split into two parts: the analysis part, and the web app part.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Both the web app and the analysis were made using the PyCharm IDE. The analysis was written in Python 2.7, utilizing sqlite and SQLAlchemy. The web app
                    was made in Flask, utilizing Javascript, jQuery, <a href="http://www.dynatable.com/">DynaTable</a>, and <a href="http://www.canvasjs.com/">CanvasJS</a>.
