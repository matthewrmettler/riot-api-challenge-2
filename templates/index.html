                    <p>Hey there! Welcome to Rylai's Resolve!</p>

                    <p>This website was made for the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/contests/riot-games-api-challenge-20">Riot API Challenge.</a>
                    I collected roughly 123,000 ranked matches across both patch 5.11 and 5.14, and started analyizing them. My goal with this project was to examine the second category: How did AP itemization change up the game? How did winrates and pickrates change?
                    More specifically, I wanted to focus on one item in particular: Rylai's Crystal Scepter.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    I've always loved Rylai's, but it used to be kind of a niche pick. It didn't offer all that much AP, so it was mainly picked up by tankier frontline mages,
                    such as Rumble or Vladimir. However, the changes to itemization not only made it contain more AP, but it also gave an amazing 40% slow on basically anything any mage did,
                    making it a <b>much</b> more attractive item for people to build.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    So that's the question: did people build it? How successful was it? Let's try to take a look.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Overall Winrates -->

                    <p>
                        First, let's take at the overall winrate of all the AP champions (I'm defining an 'AP Champion' as anyone
                        who had more than 50 games played with more than 2 AP items built over the course of the game.).
                        Click any column to sort by it,or shift-click to have that be the second sort option.
                        All rows are color-coded based the patch 5.14 winrate (green is great, red is bad).
                    </p>
                    <div class="table-container">
                        <table id="winrate-table">
                          <thead>
                            <th>Champion Name</th>
                            <th>Wins (5.11)</th>
                            <th>Losses (5.11)</th>
                            <th>Winrate (5.11)</th>
                            <th>Wins (5.14)</th>
                            <th>Losses (5.14)</th>
                            <th>Winrate (5.14)</th>
                            <th>Percent Change</th>
                          </thead>
                          <tbody>
                          </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Patch 5.14 was most kind to Janna: The cheaper AP itemization meant that support Jannas that were doing well could do even more well,
                        with cheaper sources of Ability Power, and access to the new, incredibly strong Zeke's Harbinger. Despite goals of bringing more non-traditional AP characters into the fold,
                        results are mixed: Kayle, Teemo, and Galio saw nice winrate increases, but Vladimir, Kennen, and Singed suffered a bit, and Nunu plummeted down 12%.
                        Overall, it definitely shook things up a bit, but we could use some more general data: Did pick rates change?
                    </p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Next up are the overall pick rates. Did different mages pop up and take 5.14 by storm? Let's take a look:</p>

                <div id="playrateChartContainer" style="height: 400px; width: 100%;"></div>

                <p>As you can see, Morgana and Annie dominate the chart (most likely due to their excellence in both mid and support, and occassionally top as well.)
                However, overall, the top 15 most popular midlaners did not change at all. They might have shuffled around a bit, but this solid core is still solid, and while champions below these top 15 might have seen increases,
                the ones at the top stayed at the top.

                But none of what we've seen so far says anything about Rylai's, and that's the focus of this analysis. <b>From this point on, everything we talk about is strictly patch 5.14.</b>
                <br/><br/>Let's go take a look at Rylais!</p>

                <a href="#toc_section"><img class="back-to-top-bar" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='../images/back_to_top.jpg') }}" alt="Back To Top"/></a>

            <!-- Rylai's Build Data (Table) -->
            <div class="section" id="rylai_table_section">
                <div class="section-title">

                </div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Our goal here is to see who built Rylai's, in what order, and what the winrates are in that order. I excluded any champions who had less than
                    100 total purchases of Rylai's (in my dataset of ~130,000 games.) In this case, all champions are color-coded based on their 'built Rylai's' winrate.
                    We can first look at a very overwhelming table:</p>

                    <div class="table-container">
                        <table id="rylais-table">
                          <thead>
                            <th>Champion Name</th>
                            <th>Percent Built</th>
                            <th>Built First Wins</th>
                            <th>Built Second Wins</th>
                            <th>Built Third Wins</th>
                            <th>Built First Win Percent</th>
                            <th>Built Second Win Percent</th>
                            <th>Built Third Win Percent</th>
                            <th>Built Winrate</th>
                            <th>Not Built Winrate</th>
                            <th>Percent Difference</th>
                          </thead>
                          <tbody>
                          </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        I want you to sort by the 'percent diffence' column. This will show you the change in winrate between building it and not building it.
                        Now this is just one sample of many, but it is out of 130,000 games, and I intentionally only included people who built a significant amount of Rylai's. However, there's a surprising result here:

                        <br/><br/><div class="emphasis">Not a single person's winrate goes down from building a Rylai's.</div><br/><br/>

                        Either it has no noticeable impact, or their winrate goes up drastically (in the case of Karthus, up to 30%!).
                        if you look at the most-benefitting champions, they're all mages who provide significant sustained DPS moreso than burst: Karthus, Cassiopeia, Singed, and Fiddlesticks all benefit if you're not able to get away from them,
                        and they certainly benefitted greatly from this Rylai's change.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Who benefitted the least? it looks like it's mostly champions that benefit from being in range of you, but once they're in range and their signature ability lands, their job is done: Malphite ults (and has a slow on his q); Ori's ball, if it's in range, can simply ult and doesn't benefit from a slow.
                        Malzahar will just flash ult you, and if you don't die in that, a couple seconds where you're slowed afterwards won't necessarily make or break him. If Cho'gath lands the rupture, it's basically over anyways. Even so, even in these cases where the champsions don't benefit <b>much</b>, they <i>still</i> benefit -- enough where it's worth building that Rylai's.
                        <br/><br/>
                        What about build order? There's a lot of info to process here, and in some cases it's incredibly small sample sizes, but one data point stands out at me.
                        Those 13 fiddles who built it first snowballed incredibly well and got an astounding 91% winrate; those who got it second were not so fortunate, but those who built it third brought it back to a 70% winrate. This kind of makes sense to me, as Runeglaive is not so great on Fiddle, and people stuck in your Crowstorm due to the slow would get a few extra ticks of that damage.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Now that we see winrates, let's look at the damage done and taken!

                        The color scheme for this table is based off of the KDA percent change (the last column).

                    <p>The general case seems to be again that champions who benefit from the constant slow REALLY benefit: Seeing a 30% increase in KDA on Rumble, 27% on Cassiopeia, 23% increase on Singed.
                    And that surprising result pops up again: no one's KDA actually goes down from building Rylai's. Everyone, at least slightly, has a better KDA.</p>

                This project merely scratches the tip of the iceberg as far as data and its various applications. I knew
                Rylai's was a strong item, but I did not expect such drastic winrate increases for champions in the 30% increase range,
                nor did I expect literally everyone to benefit from building a Rylai's. Lots of data was in line with what you would expect
                (high DPS mages benefitting from the slow), yet there are still surprising results in every table.
