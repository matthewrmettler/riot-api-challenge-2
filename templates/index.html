                    <p>Hey there! Welcome to Rylai's Resolve!</p>

                    <p>This website was made for the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/contests/riot-games-api-challenge-20">Riot API Challenge.</a>
                    I collected roughly 123,000 ranked matches across both patch 5.11 and 5.14, and started analyizing them. My goal with this project was to examine the second category: How did AP itemization change up the game? How did winrates and pickrates change?
                    More specifically, I wanted to focus on one item in particular: Rylai's Crystal Scepter.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    I've always loved Rylai's, but it used to be kind of a niche pick. It didn't offer all that much AP, so it was mainly picked up by tankier frontline mages,
                    such as Rumble or Vladimir. However, the changes to itemization not only made it contain more AP, but it also gave an amazing 40% slow on basically anything any mage did,
                    making it a <b>much</b> more attractive item for people to build.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    So that's the question: did people build it? How successful was it? Let's try to take a look.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Overall Winrates -->

                    <p>
                        First, let's take at the overall winrate of all the AP champions (I'm defining an 'AP Champion' as anyone
                        who had more than 50 games played with more than 2 AP items built over the course of the game.).
                        Click any column to sort by it,or shift-click to have that be the second sort option.
                        All rows are color-coded based the patch 5.14 winrate (green is great, red is bad).
                    </p>
                    <div class="table-container">
                        <table id="winrate-table">
                          <thead>
                            <th>Champion Name</th>

                          <tbody>
                          </tbody>
                        </table>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Next, we can simply see who the most popular midlaners were by playrate. Let's look at a bar graph.</p>

                <div id="playrateChartContainer" style="height: 400px; width: 100%;"></div>

                <p>As you can see, Morgana and Annie dominate the chart (most likely due to their excellence in both mid and support, and occassionally top as well.)
                But none of what we've seen so far says anything about Rylai's, so let's go take a look at that!</p>

                <a href="#toc_section"><img class="back-to-top-bar" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='../images/back_to_top.jpg') }}" alt="Back To Top"/></a>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Rylai's Build Data (Table) -->
            <div class="section" id="rylai_table_section">
                <div class="section-title">
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='../images/rylais_build_bar.jpg') }}" alt="Rylai's Build Data:"/>
                </div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Now, let's look to see who built Rylai's, in what order, and what the winrates are in that order. I excluded any champions who had less than
                    100 total purchases of Rylai's (in my dataset of ~130,000 games.) In this case, all champions are color-coded based on their 'built Rylai's' winrate.
                    We can first look at a very overwhelming table:</p>

                    <div class="table-container">
                        <table id="rylais-table">
                          <thead>
                            <th>Champion Name</th>
                            <th>Percent Built</th>
                            <th>Built First Wins</th>
                            <th>Built Second Wins</th>
                            <th>Built Third Wins</th>
                            <th>Built First Win Percent</th>
                            <th>Built Second Win Percent</th>
                            <th>Built Third Win Percent</th>
                            <th>Built Winrate</th>
                            <th>Not Built Winrate</th>
                            <th>Percent Difference</th>
                          </thead>
                          <tbody>
                          </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </div>

                    <p>I want you to sort by the 'percent diffence' column. This will show you the change in winrate between building it and not building it.
                    Now this is just one sample of many, but it is out of 130,000 games, and I intentionally only included people who built a significant amount of Rylai's, and there's a surprising result here:
                    <b>not a single person's winrate goes down from building a Rylai's</b>. Either it has no noticeable impact, or their winrate goes up drastically (in the case of Karthus, up to 30!).</p>

                    Now, let's take a look at how building Rylai's affects KDA, damage dealt, and damage taken.

                            <th>Without Kills</th>
                            <th>Without Deaths</th>

                I did not get to cover as much as I would like, due to time constraints, but I found this progress incredibly interesting. I knew
                Rylai's was a strong item, but I did not expect such drastic winrate increases for champions such as Karthus (who already had a slow),
                nor did I expect literally everyone to benefit from building a Rylai's.
